This is the final projects in the Computer Graphics course in 2018.  <br>
This is the old version of OpenGL, so it might be a litte different from the new version. <br>
I utilized "InputStl.h" to input the object and learned how to use VBO.<br>
Checked the condition of winning.<br>
Set up the cheat mode and normal mode to make the game more fun.
