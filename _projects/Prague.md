<b>A compact, low-cost and self-sustaining telemedicine device carried by unmanned aerial vehicles(UAV) to provide prenatal care in resource-scarce communities</b><br>
We participated a [competition](http://www.iupesm2018.org/) at a conference in Prague, Czech<br>

Motivation
===

- 99% of maternal deaths happen in developing countries
- 830 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth every day
- The key obstacle is pregnant women's lack of access to quality skilled care before, during and after childbirth.
- Telemedicine devices can be a solution to prenatal care in resource-scarce communities


Goal
===
- Critical measurements of prenatal health care
- Screening for high-risk conditions
- Light-weight
- Self-sustaining
- Low-cost
- Easy to operate
