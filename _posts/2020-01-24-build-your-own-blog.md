[Github Pages]() are public web pages for users, organizations, and repositories, that are freely hosted on GitHub's github.io domain or on a custom domain name of your choice. GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll behind the scenes, so they're a great way to host your Jekyll-powered website for free~~


## Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme

Minimal Mistakes is flexible two-column Jekyll theme, perfect for building personal sites, blogs, and portfolios. As the name implies, styling is puposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you.



## How did I do?

I fork [this repository](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) directly. Then revised some data and folder to make my customize website. It is really easy for beginners to start up.

Following the steps in [Part 2](https://genius92606.github.io/posts/2020-01-24-build-your-own-blog-2), you can build your own website immediately!!
