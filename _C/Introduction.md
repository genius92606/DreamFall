<u>Programming environment</u>
===

- We will be using Visual Studio 2013 as the main programming environment this semester. But if you want to use other compilers (such as DevC), it is fine too. 
- You can download Visual Studio from NCKU Computer and Network Center
	- <h1><b>Please install the Visual Studio 2013 中文專業版 before the next class!</b></h1>
- Visual Studio Express can also be freely downloaded from the Microsoft website (http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/)

<u>如何修好這門課？</u>
===

- 準備一本筆記本與資料夾
	- 筆記本用來作上課筆記、以及寫程式的心得，當寫程式參考。
	- 由於我們沒有指定課本，筆記就是最重要參考內容。
	- 上課盡量作好筆記，回家復習才容易。
	- 資料夾用於整理課堂上發的紙本資料。
	- 如果需要，去找一本C的中文參考書備用。
- 自己花時間寫程式!
	- 看懂與會寫有很大差別
	- Debug需要經驗。越常debug，越快找到程式錯誤所在
	- 不要怕犯錯。自己要努力解決錯誤，不要完全倚賴其他人幫忙
	- 如果寫程式的時間太少，上機考會有很大的困難!
	- 善用網路資源，有效利用網路資料
	- 參加TA session。作業務必自己要獨力寫出來。
- 記得：程式沒有灰色地帶，對就是對，錯就是錯。有錯必有因，有因就能解！碰到問題時，耐心找錯、細心思考，對於寫程式會是最有幫助的態度！
- 務必要跟上進度！程式的課，連貫性很強，如果落後一部分，後面會很快就崩解。
